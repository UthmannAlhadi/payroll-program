# Simple payroll program

A simple payroll program, which will read data for each employee, perform some arithmetic calculations and write results in a tabular form (table output). ![Table1](https://github.com/UthmannAlhadi/payroll-program/assets/72100326/5bfb90e3-2470-48fe-9baa-8bc9ac8a0648)


## Instruction

The payroll program may check and validate that all input values will be logically correct (ie: no negatives or special characters) and that all values will be in the specified ranges. You will write a program that computes the net monthly salary of each employee from the employee's gross monthly salary. The deductions made on monthly gross salary are for insurance and taxes. The insurance fee paid by each employee is determined from Table 2. The income tax deduction is based on the range given in Table 3. You must also calculate the average gross salary, average insurance fee, average income tax and average net salary for all the employees for whom you are given data (how many employeesâ€™ data you want to process).
